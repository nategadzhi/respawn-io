title: New website! Obsidian, Next.js, and Vercel.
excerpt: I had a couple hours on a Thursday night, and wanted to clean up my website.

Here's how this thing works:
- The [source repository is open](https://github.com/nategadzhi/respawn-io).
- It's based off Next.js static gen blog starter kit. Tailwind for markup. First time I use either of those. But hey, I have an [execute program typescript](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript) course sitting for 6 months, and I need to spike on a few typescript things at work anyway.
- I'm using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for my notes, and decided to try and use it to write the blog, too. I then `ln path/to/obsidian/vault/respawn.io/*` to my `_posts` dir. Since it's just a hard link, I can still edit in Obsidian, and then just push it up.
