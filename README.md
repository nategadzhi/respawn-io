# respawn.io source code

This repo contains the source code for (yet another?) iteration of
[respawn.io](https://respawn.io) blog. That one uses Next.js and Tailwind.

## TODO

- [ ] Plug the \_posts directory into Obsidian and see if I can manage my posts
      that way.
- [ ] Ship the first iteration to Vercel
- [ ] Setup the domain
