# respawn.io source code

This repo contains the source code for (yet another?) iteration of [respawn.io](https://respawn.io) blog. That one uses
Next.js and Tailwind.

## TODO

Aside from writing that I utterly suck at, there are a few things to clean up here.

- [ ] Posts meta-information and twitter cards.
- [ ] Add an RSS feed.
- [ ] Add MDX / images support.
- [ ] Add the About page.
