# Hi! I'm Natik

I'm a builder and a tinkerer at heart, a software engineer by training, and I'm fascinated by how people learn, grow, and organize into groups to build things together and have fun.

I work as an engineering manager at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com). We're building a [source available](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) data engineering toolkit for ELT / ELTP pipelines.

I write about engineering leadership, building software, and finding out. The
source code for this blog, along with all the essays in Markdown, are
[available on Github](https://github.com/natikgadzhi/respawn-io).
