title: There's `contentlayer2` now, and it works with `gfm` 4.0.0
---

So, [`contentlayer` has a bit of a maintenance problem](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429), but there are kind people who made [`contentlayer2` that works with remark-gfm 4](https://github.com/timlrx/contentlayer2?tab=readme-ov-file#migrating-to-the-fork).

Don't forget to say thank you to devs who keep your sites functioning for free.
