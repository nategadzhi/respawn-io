# Hi! I'm Natik

I'm a director of engineering at [Zipline](https://getzipline.com). Before that,
I've spent 10 years at [Evil Martians](https://evl.ms).

I'm a builder at heart, and a software engineer by training, and I'm fascinated
by how people learn, and organize into large groups to build things together.

I write about engineering leadership, building software, and learning. The
source code for this blog, along with all the essays in Markdown, are
[available on Github](https://github.com/natikgadzhi/respawn-io).
